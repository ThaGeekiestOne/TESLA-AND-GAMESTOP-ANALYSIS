This project is a part of the final peer-graded assignment for the IBM Data Science Certificate. The goal is to extract historical stock data and revenue data for **Tesla** and **GameStop**, then visualize the data using Python, yfinance and web scraping.

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Extract stock data using the `yfinance` library.
- Visualize trends using a custom plotting function.
- Build side-by-side dashboards to analyze stock vs revenue for both companies.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- yfinance
- Jupyter Notebook
